# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed using Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the user guesses the word one letter at a time. The player is allowed only six incorrect guesses. This project demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, lists, strings, and the random module in Python.
